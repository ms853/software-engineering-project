# Test Strategy

We decided to focus mainly on manual testing, adding to the previous manual-test-script file from the previous work sheet. We also adopted another form of manual testing, by creating documents consisting of various manual tests with screen shots of the outcome of tests. The screen shots provide visual evidence of how the system behaves, which is particularly useful to prove the authenticity of time dependent tests. We felt that conducting tests with screen shot evidence was more suitable than the format used in the manual testing script previously being used. For example, email verification and two factor authentication testing are two features that need to be tested within a certain time frame. Taking screen shots of those tests proved they worked as they should.

We also decided to implement cross browser testing to ensure that elements of the website are working properly. This is because we noticed some browsers displayed content like form fields differently, e.g. Firefox compared to Chrome. The testing will raise issues related to the browser, which can easily be fixed. The pages tested also contained the most features, meaning they were the most important to test.
