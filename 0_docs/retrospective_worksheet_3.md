# Sprint Retrospective Worksheet 3

## Two things we should stop doing:
1. Stop focusing on manual testing, we should put a bigger emphasis on automated testing.
2. Focusing on multiple features at the same time and not completing them fully.

## Two things we should continue doing:
1. Having a different branch for large size 'must' features. (Rated 30 points or over on backlog).
2. Continue using Slack as the main form of communication.

## Two things we should start doing:
1. Use an online backlog tool that is integrated with Git Hub to keep better track of task completion.
2. Make a conscious effort to provide more meaningful messages when committing to Git Hub.

From the previous sprint retrospective we used the idea of creating a new branch for big must features, this made working on code a lot neater. Big features such as course creation and the map feature and two factor authentication were three features that were developed in a separate branch and proved to be very useful when keeping things organised and conflict free.
