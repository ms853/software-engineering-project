# Sprint Retrospective Worksheet 2

## Two things we should stop doing:
1. Stop putting time and effort into researching how to implement future additional features, that may never be implemented. Use the time better by concentrating on '`must`' features, that need to be implemented more urgently than the '`could`' features.
2. Stop wasting the first week of the sprint reading the worksheet and trying to gain an understanding of the worksheet. Reading the worksheet beforehand will mean productivity is increased during the first week of the sprint and time being more efficiently used.

## Two things we should continue doing:
1. One thing we should keep is the arrangement where the scrum master - Priyan, is the only one who updates the product backlog and burndown chart. As it meant that there was no confusion when it came to changing the status of tasks and the numbers with regards to the burndown chart.
2. Continue using Slack as the main form of communication. Communication was very good throughout the team and creating multiple channels meant different topics could be discussed and the topic of discussion could easily be monitored by all. 

## Two things we should start doing:
1. Create a branch for each feature being developed. This will prevent merge conflicts and make implementing the features clearer and easier for the developer.
2. Use Trello as a tool to manage the tasks that are not appropriate for the backlog. For example, 'change the file name of 'X'' is a task where the progress needs to be tracked, but is not appropriate for the backlog. Using Trello will ensure smaller tasks progress is monitored. The use of Trello will lead to better task management and completion.
