I will also be working closely with all group members to fix any problems they may have with regards to the documents being worked on.

## Reece Wadsworth (rw235) -
As both a general Programmer and Test Author, I hope to be able to help to create a fully functional and tested version of our project with the rest of the programming team. I will be responsible for completing any tasks that have been assigned to me and ask for help if I encounter any problems. It is important to communicate clearly with others with overlapping roles and make sure that we are best positioned to create a good product by the final deadline. 

## Marco Piazzi (mp526) -
Being a Programmer and Test Author, I have the shared responsibility with other programmers to develop functional, high quality code, as well as test cases for the code. I must be able to work efficiently with other programmers on the same code and ensure that my work is legible and logical. As a Test Author I must make sure that my test scripts will provide a guarantee of high quality working code. As a Programmer in a team, I need to be available to help others as well as ask for help and from others when problems arise. 

## Peiduo Chen (pc260) -
As a Requirements Analyst and Technical Author, I will go through all the documents that the professor gave and clarify the requirements, so it will help our members to make out what they should do. After that, I will check if we reach these requirements. Being a Technical Author, I am going to prepare for the presentation. In order to do the presentation, I will sort the project and then present it in a user-friendly way. On the other hand, I will help Priyan make sure the documents are easy to understand.

As a Programmer and a Risk Manager, I will be working alongside developers in the team to implement the required features that are fully functional and of high quality. This will require me to be an effective team member and deliver every task that I will be assigned to do. My main role as a Risk manager will be to identify potential risks that could occur and affect the project's success and produce strategies that will help overcome these risks when they happen.

## Michael Sakyiama (ms853) -

I will be responsible for checking whether the software product and documentation relating to the product complies with the requirements of the client. In addition, I am responsible for providing clarity to the requirements so that the members of my group understand what is required. Further, my duties as a support programmer is to liaise with the Architect and fellow developers to help design the software and fix any bugs regarding the product.  

## Sean Dewar (sdjd1) -
As an Architect and Programmer, I have the responsibility of creating the high-level architectural design of the system while ensuring that submitted code is of a high standard that adheres to the technical specifications that we have set. To achieve this, I will: maintain a strong level of communication with the other programmers on the team, create specifications such as class diagrams that reflect the evolving state of the system, utilise code review techniques ensuring only high-quality code is submitted to allow for system maintainability, and ensure our continuous integration system is working optimally with effective build and test automation.
