# software-engineering-project

This project allowed me to gain experience and develop knowledge of how software development is carried out using agile principles such as: Scrum, Continuous Integration (CI using Travis). It also allowed me to gain an understanding of every role in an agile project.  		My role in the project was a compliance officer/requirements analyst - which involved identifying and writing good requirements. On the technical side, I assisted my group as a front/back-end developer.  This allowed me to develop my knowledge of Java Spring MVC, Bootstrap and JavaScript.
